## Project Description

### Brief
In this project your team will be building a front-end application to consolidate the work you have done with JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS. You will have one week to research, plan and develop your application before you have the opportunity to present your work to your colleagues, instructors and clients.

For this project you will be building a React application to act as a front-end for one of the APIs built during the server-side projects. Your group will be working with an API none of you have seen before and you will need to familiarise yourselves with it before you start developing your app.

### Tech Stack

This is a front-end project which should be built using:
- JavaScript + React
- HTML
- CSS
- The API asigned to your group



## Setup Instructions

    1. Clone the Repo in terminal: git clone git@github.com:Aaron-Nazareth/Wordle-Helper.git
    2. Open server-side repo ("Wordle-Helper") in IntelliJ and run the SpringBoot application ("WordleHelperApplication.java").
    3. Open client-side repo ("wordle-helper_client_side") in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and run the following code in the VSC in-built terminal:
        - npm install
        - npm start
    4. Use our Wordle Helper Application to support you through your Wordle struggles! (Instructions on how to use the helper specifically are available as a pop-up within the application)
